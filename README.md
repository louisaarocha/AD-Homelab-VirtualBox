3. **Create Administrative account** 
   - Establish a dedicated Domain Adminstrator account.
      - Note: Create my own dedicated admin account, instead of using the default admin account.
   - Windows Administrative Tools -> Active Directory Users and Computers 
   - Create an Organizational Unit (OU) to organize administrative accounts.
      - Assign domain admin privileges to a specific user.
   - Create sub Organization Unit for users.

4. **Network Configuration: RAS/NAT**
   - Set up RAS/NAT (Remote Access Server/Network Address Translation) to enable private network clients to access the internet through the Domain Controller.
   - Purpose: To allow Windows 10 clients to be on a private virtual network and still be able to access the internet through the domain.

</p>
<br>

5. **DHCP Server Set up** 
   - Set up DHCP server on the Domain Controller, allowing client computers to obtain IP addresses automatically.
      - Range: 172.16.0.100-200
      - Mask: 255.255.255.0
      - Gateway: 172.168.0.1
      - DNS: 172.16.0.1
   - Note: When AD DS is installed on the Domain Controller, it automatically installs DNS. Use DC as DNS server.  
   - Configure address lease durations and DHCP options, including DNS and gateway settings.

## Real-Life Scenario: Account Creation Process

Imagine this real-life scenario: You've just been hired, and your name has been added to a batch file. The following morning, like clockwork, the batch script runs, orchestrating the creation of all the new accounts, including yours. With this automated process in place, you find your account ready and waiting. Now, consider your "Client 1 VM" â€“ your corporate laptop. Thanks to this streamlined system, you can seamlessly log in using your credentials, as it's now part of the domain and fully integrated into the network. This straightforward account creation process demonstrates the power of automation and efficient network management.

## Real-Life Scenario: Group Policy 

### User and Group Management
In a real-world scenario, I facilitated efficient user and group management by creating a new user, 'Bob Ross,' and establishing a dedicated 'Sales' group tailored to the sales department's needs. This streamlined user access, ensuring that team members like Bob had the appropriate permissions to collaborate effectively.

### Folder Sharing and Permissions
For enhanced data accessibility and security, I transformed the 'Sales Data' folder into a shared network resource. Leveraging precise permissions tailored to the 'Sales' group, I safeguarded sensitive data, illustrating the crucial role of Active Directory group policies in controlling access to critical resources.

### Computer Account Configuration
In a practical demonstration of domain integration, I seamlessly renamed a computer to 'Client2' and seamlessly integrated it into the domain environment. Additionally, I expanded the network by creating a third VM to represent a client computer running Windows 10. I took measures to ensure connectivity by connecting the client VM to the VirtualBox private network. The computer renaming process, along with joining it to the domain, exemplifies the real-life relevance of Active Directory in managing organizational resources.

### Organizational Unit (OU) Structure
In a corporate setting, I strategically organized our Active Directory by establishing Organizational Units (OUs) tailored to the Atlanta office location, Atlanta users, and Atlanta computer accounts. This pragmatic approach allowed us to efficiently manage users like Bob Ross, moving them from the default "Users" container to specific OUs, aligning with their roles and locations.

### Password Security
Adhering to industry best practices, I bolstered password security by implementing policies that required Bob Ross to reset his password upon initial login. This real-world security measure aligns with the broader objective of safeguarding sensitive information and user accounts.

### Group Policy Administration
Our practical application of the Group Policy extended to customizing wallpaper and power settings for Atlanta users. This hands-on experience underscores the significance of Group Policy in managing and optimizing user experiences within an organization, emphasizing its real-life relevance in day-to-day IT administration.
